## [1.20.0]

*This work is still experimental*

This version includes an attempt to create a full parser/lexer (albeit slow) for MaxScript. Is still experimental and not optimized, it could fail often, since the loose type nature MaxScript I've found hard to account for all the possible syntaxes.
I intend to add a code Formatter, Workspace support, and other vscode features in the future.
